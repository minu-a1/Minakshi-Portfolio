                    World Theatre Day was initiated in 1961 by the International Theatre Institute ITI. It is celebrated annually on the 27th March by ITI Centres and the international theatre community.One of the most important of these is the circulation of the World Theatre Day Message through which at the invitation of ITI, a figure of world stature shares his or her reflections on the theme of Theatre and a Culture of Peace. The first World Theatre Day Message was written by Jean Cocteau in 1962.

                    World Theatre Day is observed to generate awareness about the importance of theatre in our life as theatre is an art form which comprises live performers, actors, props and more but nowadays, with the advent of movie halls and platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the importance of theatre is not the same as it used to be before

                    The World Theatre Day started as a movement, but later on it was celebrated to give a fresh direction and meaning to life as theatre has a pertinent role to play in oneâ€™s life with its healthy effect on a person and the society, since most of the themes have a strong bonding with the real life events.
